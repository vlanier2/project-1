"""
  A trivial web server in Python.

  Based largely on https://docs.python.org/3.4/howto/sockets.html
  This trivial implementation is not robust:  We have omitted decent
  error handling and many other things to keep the illustration as simple
  as possible.

  This program starts a webserver on a port specified in credentials.ini.
  The server looks for files specified by DOCROOT also in credentials.ini.
  Currently, the server only responds to GET requests for files in DOCROOT.
  Error 404 is transmitted when the requested file is not found in DOCROOT. 
  Error 403 is transmitted when illegal characters are found in the request.
  Error 401 is transmitted for any requests other than GET.
